Currently, I am collaborating remotely with Prof. Lin Zhao from Department of Biomedical Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology(NJIT). My work focuses on developing large language model (LLM)–enhanced medical image segmentation algorithms. 
This June, I completed the Graduate Academic Preparation Program at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I conducted Large FOV Opto-stimulation research in Prof. Spencer LaVere Smith’s lab. I have also graduated from the Bachelor-Master-PhD Integrated Innovation Honors Program in Optoelectronics at the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

#### Education
Graduate Academic Preparation Program, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,Santa Barbara, 2024—2025 \
B.E., Opto-electronic Information Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2021—2025 

#### Research Interests
My research interests include <strong>Imaging, Biomedical Applications of Imaging Techniques</strong>,and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. During my studies at HUST, I gained extensive knowledge in optics. However, I believe deep learning and neural networks are powerful tools with great future potential. Therefore, I took the initiative to learn deep learning, with the aim of integrating it into optical tasks.
