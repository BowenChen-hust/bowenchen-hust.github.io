#### Education
Graduate Academic Preparation Program, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,Santa Barbara, 2024—2025 (expected).\
B.E., Opto-electronic Information Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2021—2025 (expected).

#### Research Interests
My research interests include <strong>Imaging, Biomedical Applications of Imaging Techniques</strong>,and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. During my studies at HUST, I gained extensive knowledge in optics. However, I believe deep learning and neural networks are powerful tools with great future potential. Therefore, I took the initiative to learn deep learning, with the aim of integrating it into optical tasks.
