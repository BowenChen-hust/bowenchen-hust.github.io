This study explores the potential application of Dammann gratings and femtosecond laser direct writing technology in the fabrication of optical devices. By simulating one-dimensional and two-dimensional Dammann gratings, we successfully validated the theoretical predictions regarding focusing efficiency and uniformity. In the fabrication process, we developed a customized track processing code for femtosecond laser direct writing and successfully produced a Dammann grating element with dimensions of 120 × 120 μm. A comparison between the actual diffraction pattern and the simulation results confirmed the reliability of our simulations.
