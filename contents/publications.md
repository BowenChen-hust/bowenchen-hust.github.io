- #### Fourier Light-field Microscopy Based on Deep Learning with Enhanced Depth of Focus and Resolution
<b>Abstract</b>: The two-stage microscopy technique based on Fourier Light Field Microscopy and VCD deep learning reconstruction strategies(F-VCD) has achieved remarkable success in fast 3D super-resolution reconstruction. However, it performs poorly in terms of refocusing depth. In practice, F-VCD can only achieve effective reconstruction within a 3µm thickness, which is less than the typical thickness of a cell. To address this, we have designed a new optical setup and a Vision Transformer-based network that combines two imaging modalities: one with 3 views MLA(high lateral resolution but low refocusing depth), and the other with 7 views MLA(high refocusing depth but low lateral resolution). This combination enables outputs with both high lateral resolution and high refocusing depth, expanding its potential applications. (Below is a draft of the network and this work is ongoing and is expected to be published by the end of 2024.)

- #### SR-PRNet: High-ﬁdelity Phase Reconstruction from onlyOne High-level Feature Channel
<b>Abstract</b>: Despite extensive efforts to apply deep learning to phase reconstruction in off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI), significant challenges persist as deep learning models tend to generate smoothed predictions rather than accurately representing ground truths. This phenomenon is well-known as ill-posed problem, wherein our specific scenario highlights the tendency of deep learning models to produce an averaged phase map of all potential high-resolution phase maps, rather than the phase map with the highest resolution. These challenges stem from the complexities of achieving precise input-output mapping, driven by domain disparities and the necessity for additional calibration images. Moreover, prevalent multi-level perception model architectures impose limitations on deep learning models to learn low-level phase features from interferograms in the spatial domain. Consequently, the redundant low-level feature channels exacerbates the degradation of model predictions. To address these issues, we propose Super Resolution Phase Reconstruction Net (SR-PRNet), a novel deep learning model structure. Unlike conventional methods that introduce low-level features directly, SR-PRNet dynamically generates these features without supervision, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of redundant channels. Specifically, SR-PRNet relies on the supervision of only one high-level feature channel, which is subsequently processed through a super-resolution tail guided by an adversarial loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that SR-PRNet outperforms the U-Net baseline, achieving superior high-ﬁdelity predictions and numerical criteria.(This work is ongoing)

<b>Abstract</b>: A metasurface is a new type of optical element composed of a two-dimensional array of periodic subwavelength structures, offering highly flexible optical response characteristics. By designing sophisticated subwavelength structures, metasurfaces can achieve arbitrary control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light. As a result, metasurfaces demonstrate great application potential in fields such as flat lenses, holographic imaging, beam shaping, and polarization devices. This paper presents the design of a broadband focusing meta-lens based on metasurfaces and geometric phase (Pancharatnam-Berry phase). The circular polarization conversion efficiency of the metasurface reaches over 96%, and it is capable of focusing circularly polarized light at different wavelengths. For incident light with wavelengths of 621 nm and 671 nm, the simulated focal length is around 50 micrometers, while for incident light with a wavelength of 721 nm, the simulated focal length is approximately 45 micrometers, closely matching the theoretical value of 50 micrometers.

Curriculum Design:Served as deputy leader, School of Optical and Electronic Information, HUST (Sept.2023 - Jan.2024)

<b>Abstract</b>: The Dammann grating is a novel type of binary optical device capable of generating beam-splitting arrays with any desired number of beams using only two distinct height distributions on its surface. Its simplicity and efficiency in beam splitting significantly reduce the cost and complexity of optical systems. Femtosecond laser direct writing technology is highly suitable for fabricating micro-optical devices due to its high precision, excellent resolution, and minimal thermal effects.In this study, we combined Dammann grating theory with femtosecond laser direct writing technology. We simulated both one-dimensional and two-dimensional Dammann gratings, verifying the theoretical predictions regarding focusing efficiency and uniformity. Additionally, we developed a custom track processing code to fabricate 120 × 120 μm Dammann grating elements. The actual diffraction pattern was compared with the simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the simulations. Furthermore, we compared the beam-splitting performance of the Dammann grating with that of a multi-level phase grating, identifying potential limitations and proposing optimizations for the Dammann grating.
