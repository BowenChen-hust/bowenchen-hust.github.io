- #### Fourier Light-field Microscopy Based on Deep Learning with Enhanced Depth of Focus and Resolution
<b>Abstract</b>: The two-stage microscopy technique based on Fourier Light Field Microscopy and VCD deep learning reconstruction strategies(F-VCD) has achieved remarkable success in fast 3D super-resolution reconstruction. However, it performs poorly in terms of refocusing depth. In practice, F-VCD can only achieve effective reconstruction within a 3µm thickness, which is less than the typical thickness of a cell. To address this, we have designed a new optical setup and a Vision Transformer-based network that combines two imaging modalities: one with 3 views MLA(high lateral resolution but low refocusing depth), and the other with 7 views MLA(high refocusing depth but low lateral resolution). This combination enables outputs with both high lateral resolution and high refocusing depth, expanding its potential applications. (Below is a draft of the network and this work is ongoing and is expected to be published by the end of 2024.)

- #### Cell Recognition from Interferometric Fringe Images Based on Deep Learning
<b>Abstract</b>: Cell recognition is a crucial image analysis task with significant implications for clinical diagnostics. Traditionally, accurate cell recognition has been achieved by first using interferometric fringe images to perform phase retrieval, followed by cell segmentation on the resulting phase images, and ultimately cell recognition based on the segmentation results. Although effective, this approach is time-consuming and inefficient. We aim to develop a novel network that can directly recognize cells from interferometric fringe images, bypassing the intermediate steps to enhance efficiency and speed.(This work is ongoing)

<b>Abstract</b>: A metasurface is a new type of optical element composed of a two-dimensional array of periodic subwavelength structures, offering highly flexible optical response characteristics. By designing sophisticated subwavelength structures, metasurfaces can achieve arbitrary control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light. As a result, metasurfaces demonstrate great application potential in fields such as flat lenses, holographic imaging, beam shaping, and polarization devices. This paper presents the design of a broadband focusing meta-lens based on metasurfaces and geometric phase (Pancharatnam-Berry phase). The circular polarization conversion efficiency of the metasurface reaches over 96%, and it is capable of focusing circularly polarized light at different wavelengths. For incident light with wavelengths of 621 nm and 671 nm, the simulated focal length is around 50 micrometers, while for incident light with a wavelength of 721 nm, the simulated focal length is approximately 45 micrometers, closely matching the theoretical value of 50 micrometers.

Curriculum Design:Served as deputy leader, School of Optical and Electronic Information, HUST (Sept.2023 - Jan.2024)

<b>Abstract</b>: The Dammann grating is a novel type of binary optical device capable of generating beam-splitting arrays with any desired number of beams using only two distinct height distributions on its surface. Its simplicity and efficiency in beam splitting significantly reduce the cost and complexity of optical systems. Femtosecond laser direct writing technology is highly suitable for fabricating micro-optical devices due to its high precision, excellent resolution, and minimal thermal effects.In this study, we combined Dammann grating theory with femtosecond laser direct writing technology. We simulated both one-dimensional and two-dimensional Dammann gratings, verifying the theoretical predictions regarding focusing efficiency and uniformity. Additionally, we developed a custom track processing code to fabricate 120 × 120 μm Dammann grating elements. The actual diffraction pattern was compared with the simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the simulations. Furthermore, we compared the beam-splitting performance of the Dammann grating with that of a multi-level phase grating, identifying potential limitations and proposing optimizations for the Dammann grating.
