Abstract:A metasurface is a new type of optical element composed of a two-dimensional array of periodic subwavelength structures, offering highly flexible optical response characteristics. By designing sophisticated subwavelength structures, metasurfaces can achieve arbitrary control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light. As a result, metasurfaces demonstrate great application potential in fields such as flat lenses, holographic imaging, beam shaping, and polarization devices. This paper presents the design of a broadband focusing meta-lens based on metasurfaces and geometric phase (Pancharatnam-Berry phase). The circular polarization conversion efficiency of the metasurface reaches over 96%, and it is capable of focusing circularly polarized light at different wavelengths. For incident light with wavelengths of 621 nm and 671 nm, the simulated focal length is around 50 micrometers, while for incident light with a wavelength of 721 nm, the simulated focal length is approximately 45 micrometers, closely matching the theoretical value of 50 micrometers.

Abstract:The Dammann grating is a novel type of binary optical device capable of generating beam-splitting arrays with any desired number of beams using only two distinct height distributions on its surface. Its simplicity and efficiency in beam splitting significantly reduce the cost and complexity of optical systems. Femtosecond laser direct writing technology is highly suitable for fabricating micro-optical devices due to its high precision, excellent resolution, and minimal thermal effects.In this study, we combined Dammann grating theory with femtosecond laser direct writing technology. We simulated both one-dimensional and two-dimensional Dammann gratings, verifying the theoretical predictions regarding focusing efficiency and uniformity. Additionally, we developed a custom track processing code to fabricate 120 × 120 μm Dammann grating elements. The actual diffraction pattern was compared with the simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the simulations. Furthermore, we compared the beam-splitting performance of the Dammann grating with that of a multi-level phase grating, identifying potential limitations and proposing optimizations for the Dammann grating.
